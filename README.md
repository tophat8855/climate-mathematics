# Plan

## Goals

- Work through the (https://climatemathematics.sdsu.edu/)[Climate Mathematics] textbook, using Clay to document my progress.

### Things I've come across/need to revisit
- Viz only works for kind v3 and the most recent kind that is in my deps.edn is v4. Perhaps, PR to update it?
- Hanami should be able to calculate a trend line and show it on the scatterplot, but not sure how to do that.
