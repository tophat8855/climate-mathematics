;; # Heather's little clay notebook

;; This is a playground where I'm trying to learn Clay and play with some of the scicloj stuff.

;; ## Goals of this Notebook
;; - Work through the [Climate Mathematics](https://climatemathematics.sdsu.edu/) textbook,
;; using Clay to document my progress.

;; ## About me
;; I am a professional clojure software engineer, and I am on the Board for
;; [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/). I live in the SF Bay Area
;; and ride my bike around a lot.
